  <h2 id="second-header">Top Five Birding Tips</h2>
  <ol>
      <li class="link"><span class="tip">Dress For Success: </span>One of the wonderful things about birding is that you don’t necessarily need anything special to get started! All you really need is your eyes and ears. However, many birders find that their birding experience is enhanced by some outdoor gear — such as binoculars to get a clearer and closer look at faraway birds. The National Audobon Society, a nationally recognized non-profit environmental organization that is dedicated to conserving bird species and their habitats, provides a helpful <a href="https://www.audubon.org/gear/binocular-guide">Binocular guide</a> and <a href="https://www.audubon.org/news/the-audubon-guide-birding-gear">Birding Gear guide</a>.</li>

      <li class="link"><span class="tip">Listen Up: </span> The funny thing about birding is that sometimes birds are easier to hear than to see. Listening out for a bird’s song (tweet or chirp pattern) can help you spot where it’s perching at. As you become more familiar with common bird songs, you’ll start recognizing some birds without even looking and begin to pick out different song quirks too! Being able to note the different bird voices will be a major help since some bird species look very similar to one another. Many different birding apps, such as the Audobon and Cornell’s Lab of Ornithology (the study of birds) <a href="https://ebird.org/home"> eBird app </a>includes recordings that can help you learn songs too!</li>

      <li class="link"><span class="tip">Take Notes: </span> Whether you are a beginner birder or a seasoned birder, it’s always helpful to jot down a few notes of a bird you see, or if you have the chance, draw up a quick sketch of the bird too! Without taking notes, many birders have a difficult time remembering all the birds they see during their outing — it’s especially useful when you want to reference your guidebook later. And while taking pictures of the birds are a nice alternative, taking notes or sketching a bird will help you focus on the details — it’s appearance, habitat and behavior — for future reference. </li>

      <li class="link"><span class="tip">Reach Out: </span> As previously mentioned, the Audobon Society is one of many organizations that promotes the conservation of birds, their habitats and taking care of the earth and the nature it provides. If possible, checking out and joining the <a href="https://mobirds.org/"> Audobon Society of Missouri </a> or your local Audobon chapter (or maybe a community birding club) will help you build on your birding skills. As fun as it sounds to go on an adventure alone outdoors, the company of another birder, maybe one with a little more experience, will open your world and help you add a few more tools to your evergrowing bag.  </li>
      <li class="link"><span class="tip">Have Fun Out There: </span> THE NUMBER ONE RULE OF BIRDING? Have fun learning! No matter what trail you walk on, park you visit or backyard window you look out of, you are sure to find a bird tweeting away. You’re also bound to find another birder out there who has notes and experiences to share. Making friends, expanding on your bird knowledge, and caring for the great outdoors is what makes birding one of the fastest growing outdoor activities in the U.S. today! </li>
