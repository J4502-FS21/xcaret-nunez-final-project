  <div class="link">
  <p id="decorate">Missouri is the most mid-state you can get – and that’s a good thing! Missouri is a place where a variety of regions come together and create an array of bird habitats. In fact, Missouri has about 438 bird species with 340 of them considered residential birds.  Below are five of Missouri's most common residential birds, and you might even be able to find them in your backyard! If you're interested to find out more, all the birds identified here are sourced by the Cornell Lab's <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/news/">"All About Birds"</a> tool and the <a href="https://www.audubon.org/bird-guide?site=mo&nid=4171">"Audobon Bird Guide."</a> By clicking each image, you'll be redirected to Cornell Lab's site to hear bird sounds corresponding to the bird you select.</p>

    <li class="space"><span class="tip">Markings: </span>Tufted Titmice have a lovely silvery-blue color on their back, wings, and tail. Its chest and belly are white with a peachy coloration on its sides (peaking right underneath its wings). The titmice’s bluey color gives its eyes a wider look and gives the impression it’s bigger than it actually is. This birdy also has a distinct black patch right above its tiny, slightly curved bill. </li>
    <li class="space"><span class="tip">Size: </span>Both males and females measure from 5.5 to 6.3 inches in length and have a wingspan of 7.9 to 10.2 inches. </li>

    <li class="space"><span class="tip">Habitat: </span>You can tell titmice’s favorite color is green because they love being around evergreen and bushy woodland areas — but they also like to visit the occasional park and backyard.</li>

    <li class="space"><span class="tip">Habitat: </span> Junco’s enjoy living and exploring the open woods — more specifically they love spending time in pine-like trees (coniferous forests). But all is fair game when they’re out foraging so keep an eye out at the park or your backyard because you might just get a visit from a Junco. </li>
